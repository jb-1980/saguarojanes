        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
          We seek to follow the admonition of Jesus to his disciples as recorded
          in Matthew 14:16, "They do not need to go away. You give them something
          to eat." We will do this by actively working with organizations in our
          community to gather food to distribute to those who are hungry.
        </p>
        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Saguaro Jane's begin in the 1940s when a small group of women decided
          to assist the families of those who had loved ones who went off to war.
          Since then, our organization has grown to a group of FIND THE NUMBER of
          men and women volunteers who work tirelessly to provide food to our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          True to our desire to help, our organization is composed of volunteers.
          No one is paid, and all donations go to helping out the hungry and needy
          through our various programs. Thanks to the generous donations of others,
          we are able to make a difference in our community and give something to
          eat to the hungry.
        </p>
    <!-- Text taken from newspaper article
    Saguaro Jane's in Wittmann was formed in the early 1940s by five or six women
    to assist families whose loved ones went off to war. The non-profit organization
    now has 25 women and men as members. These volunteers are at the center at 9 a.m.
    Thursdays for Brown Bag Day, a huge food program the Saguaro Jane's organization
    operates in conjunction with the St. Mary's Food Bank. The center is on the
    southern side of U.S. 60 on Wilson Avenue. Between 17,000 and 20,000 pounds
    of produce, meat, bread and dairy products are delivered. The volunteers unload
    the truck, sort the food items and pack food boxes for 275 families, all from
    the Wickenburg, Morristown, Circle City, Wittmann and Surprise areas. These
    families start lining up outside the center by 7 a.m. and the doors open at
    10. The volunteers help direct the participants to their food boxes and if
    they need assistance they help carry the boxes to their vehicles. Volunteers
    do salvaging the first Friday of every month. A truck brings boxed, canned
    foods and drinks from St. Mary's Food Bank. These are sorted, washed and given
    out on Brown Bag Day. On the third Monday of the Month, the center holds three
    other food programs. These are Commodities, Food Plus (a federal program) and
    the Value Box. More than 300 families participate on this day. Saguaro Jane's
    also has a thrift store where many residents shop weekly. Clothing, shoes,
    kitchen items, knickknacks, toys, linens and other items are donated. This
    store is maintained by volunteers and all monetary donations goes to pay
    expenses to keep the Saguaro Jane's center open. Without the many volunteers
    generously giving their time, these programs would not have the success they
    do in serving the needs of the community.
